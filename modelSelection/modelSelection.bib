	abstract = {A difficulty that frequently arises when stock-recruitment relationships are fitted to historical data of fish populations is the high degree of variation in recruitment so that the relationship is difficult to identify with any precision. The purpose of this paper is to describe refinements that can be made to the model by incorporating information on parallel environmental factors that also affect recruitment. The identification of the stock-recruitment relationship can be made with greater precision because of the reduction in the unexplained variability. Many investigations on the effects of environmental changes on recruitment have been published in the fisheries literature. It is, however, comparatively rare for the simultaneous effects on recruitment of environmental factors and stock size to be analysed. Here we describe the formulation of an appropriate mathematical relationship to describe these effects. The framework of this formulation is F.E.J. Fry's classification of environmental factors into one of five kinds: controlling, limiting, lethal, masking and directive, following the work of Neill et al. (1994) [Neill, W.H., Miller, J.M., Van der Veer, H.W, Winemuller, K.D., 1994. Ecophysiology of marine fish recruitment: a conceptual framework for understanding interannual variability. Neth. J. Sea Res. 32, 135–152.]. An examination of some of the theory underpinning stock-recruitment relationships indicates how independent experimental evidence on the effects of environmental factors on recruitment can be incorporated into the relationship in an appropriate mathematical form. A method is described for the graphical illustration of the relationship between, on the one hand, stock and recruitment allowing for the effects of environmental factors and, on the other hand, the relationship between environmental factors and recruitment allowing for changes in stock levels. The method is based on the idea of partial residuals (or adjusted variables) derived from statistical regression methodology. The scatter of the adjusted variables around the fitted relationship is often considerably less than that of the raw data. The method is illustrated by two examples of flatfish stocks, plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) in the North Sea and English sole (Pleuronectes vetulus) in the Hecate Strait off the coast of British Columbia.},

	abstract = {Understanding of the processes affecting recruitment of commercially important fish spe-cies is one of the major challenges in fisheries science. Towards this aim, we investigated the relation between North Sea hydrography (temperature and salinity) and fish stock vari-ables (recruitment, spawning stock biomass and pre-recruitment survival index) for 9 com-mercially important fishes using spatially-resolved cross-correlation analysis. We used high-resolution (0.2° × 0.2°) hydrographic data fields matching the maximal temporal extent of the fish population assessments (1948–2013). Our approach allowed for the identification of regions in the North Sea where environmental variables seem to be more influential on the fish stocks, as well as the regions of a lesser or nil influence. Our results confirmed previ-ously demonstrated negative correlations between temperature and recruitment of cod and plaice and identified regions of the strongest correlations (German Bight for plaice and north-western North Sea for cod). We also revealed a positive correlation between herring spawning stock biomass and temperature in the Orkney-Shetland area, as well as a nega-tive correlation between sole pre-recruitment survival index and temperature in the German Bight. A strong positive correlation between sprat stock variables and salinity in the central North Sea was also found. To our knowledge the results concerning correlations between North Sea hydrography and stocks' dynamics of herring, sole and sprat are novel. The new information about spatial distribution of the correlation provides an additional help to identify mechanisms underlying these correlations. As an illustration of the utility of these results for fishery management, an example is provided that incorporates the identified environmental covariates in stock-recruitment models.},

	abstract = {Marine organisms are subject to environmental variability on various temporal and spatial scales, which affect processes related to growth and mortality of different life stages. Marine scientists are often faced with the challenge of identifying environmental variables that best explain these processes, which, given the complexity of the interactions, can be like searching for a needle in the proverbial haystack. Even after initial hypothesisbased variable selection, a large number of potential candidate variables can remain if different lagged and seasonal influences are considered. To tackle this problem, we propose a machine learning framework that incorporates important steps in model building, ranging from environmental signal extraction to automated variable selection and model validation. Its modular structure allows for the inclusion of both parametric and machine learning models, like random forest. Unsupervised feature extractions via empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) or self-organising maps (SOMs) are demonstrated as a way to summarize spatiotemporal fields for inclusion in predictive models. The proposed framework offers a robust way to reduce model complexity through a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGAII) combined with rigorous cross-validation. We applied the framework to recruitment of the North Sea cod stock and investigated the effects of sea surface temperature (SST), salinity and currents on the stock via a modified version of random forest. The best model (5-fold CV r2 = 0.69) incorporated spawning stock biomass and EOF-derived time series of SST and salinity anomalies acting through different seasons, likely relating to differing environmental effects on specific life-history stages during the recruitment year.},
